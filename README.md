# Obstacle Course Game!#

The goal of the game is for player to traverse from one corner of the platform to another, avoiding as many obstacles as possible. There are static obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and unseen obstacles that will appear and collide with the player as time passes.

This game is made in Unity. It's my first Unity project.
